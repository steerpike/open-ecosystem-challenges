# Open Ecosystem Challenges

Welcome to Open Ecosystem Challenges! 🚀

These are **hands-on, recurring prompts** designed to help you practice **Cloud Native, OpenTelemetry, AI/ML**, and
other **open source skills**.

Each challenge runs in a **pre-provisioned environment**, so you can focus on solving real problems, not setup
headaches.

**What makes these challenges special:**

- 🎯 **Skill-focused** - Target specific technologies with clear objectives
- 📖 **Story-driven** - Learn through engaging narratives
- 🚀 **Zero setup** - Run in GitHub Codespaces, pre-configured and ready
- ✅ **Two-step verification** - [Smoke tests and GitHub Actions](verification.md) validate your solution
- 🎓 **Three levels** - Beginner, Intermediate, and Expert for each adventure

## 🎮 How It Works

**Each level is independent** - start anywhere, complete in any order. Levels share a connected story but have their own:

- Codespace configuration
- Documentation and guides
- Validation tests

**Levels:**

- 🟢 **Beginner**: New to the technology? Start here to learn the basics
- 🟡 **Intermediate**: Comfortable with fundamentals? Practice advanced patterns
- 🔴 **Expert**: Want a real challenge? Tackle complex real-world scenarios

## ✅ How to Verify Your Solution

Each challenge includes a two-step verification process:

1. **Smoke Test** - Run locally in your Codespace for quick validation
2. **GitHub Actions Workflow** - Comprehensive verification you manually trigger after pushing

> 📖 **Learn more:** Read the complete [Verification Guide](verification.md) for detailed instructions on both steps.

## ❓ FAQ

**Do I need to complete levels in order?**  
No! Each level is independent. Start wherever you feel comfortable.

**Can I use these for team training?**  
Absolutely! Perfect for upskilling, onboarding, internal training, and hackathons.

**Are there costs?**  
GitHub Codespaces offers free hours per month - usually sufficient for individual use. Check [GitHub's pricing](https://github.com/features/codespaces) for details.

**Need help?**  
Check adventure-specific docs, [open an issue](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/open-ecosystem-challenges/issues), or start a [discussion](https://community.open-ecosystem.com/c/challenges).
